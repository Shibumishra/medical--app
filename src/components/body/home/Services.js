                            <p>I was young when doctors caught my Cushing’s disease, and they caught it quickly. I believe that had something to do with my personal story. Cushing’s causes damage that takes time to improve. Remember, your organs and brain are resetting after years of illness. It’ll take time to get back to a good spot.</p>

                            <p>Last week, I wrote about my experience with Cushing’s recovery. I discussed what it was like to have surgery and be in the hospital, and the steps that were taken afterward. Last week’s column had an error: It should have said that this week, I would discuss recovery after being in the hospital and heading home. Apologies for any confusion it may have caused!.</p>

                            <p>Medicaid expansion is still very much a consideration in the states that have not enacted it. Whether they have done so already or are contemplating it, bringing more individuals into the Medicaid ranks will need to be dealt with in a way that will provide quality care to patients, not inferior care, and not bankrupt the states.</p>
